# Photo Gallery [In progress]

![Photo Gallery App Demo](/demo.gif)
A photo gallery app to display 3 random sets of photos in two animated layouts: Mosaic and Carousel.

The objective of this project is to learn automated testing for react by using Jest, Enzyme and React Testing Library.
In order to enhance my CSS skills for advanced front-end effects, CSS grid, animation and transition are also the main learning focus for this project.
To understand Docker better, it is aimed to ship this app as a docker image.

## Progress

The core of the app is basically done. You may see it on my [deployment page](https://shan-photo-gallery.herokuapp.com/).

### More to do:

1. I have included some basic unit tests for the app, but more tests are needed.
2. create docker image for the app
3. more reponsive layout for mobile

## Build with

- React.js
